I got my first taste of [CodeMania] last year and got my mind blown especially by the multi-coloured musings of [Lea Verou] 
and blue-tinged graphs of [Jim Webber].  

> This year I was a repeat offender and I don't regret it.

When [Andrew Sorensen] finished the day by creating multiple styles of music with a bit of maths and some custom lisp, 
and then edited the code on-stage to change the music while it was playing, I was hooked again.

For those of you who have yet to come across CodeMania, it is a short conference in Auckland aimed directly at developers, 
and organised by two local developers [Ian Randall] and [Ben Gracewood].  They work really hard to get a succinct group of speakers 
that are all worth the time to listen to.

This year to keep track of want I wanted to remember I quickly tweeted snippets under the conference hash tag [#codemania].  
I have compiled my experiences in a mindmap.

[Adrian Cockcroft] was a really interesting speaker to listen to as he's spent a number of years with things like micro-services, 
immutable container deployments and dealing with big wads of video data building the NetFlix infrastructure.  

Mixing this with some arduino and multi-media mashing with [Raquel Vélez] and [Sarah Hui] and the intriguing world of (in)security with [Laura Bell] 
made for a diverse and pleasing cocktail.

### TL;DR

So to finish with, a selection of my take-aways from the speakers are:
* Open-source all my little experiments, share them, and blog about learnings.
* Measure customer transaction success using your site.  Up-time is just a pseudo-metric for this.
* An unimportant website might be hacked for resources and not content.  (e.g. to run bitcoin mining using your AWS cpu time)

I'm definitely planning on going back for my fix again next year - if you're a kiwi you should go too!
