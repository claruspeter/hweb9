Hello, and welcome to my first blog entry as software development consultant at [Clarus](http://clarus.co.nz){:target="_blank"}. But, before I start, let me introduce myself.

![NOBORDER](/assets/post_images/intro_hello sticker.png)
 
My name is Peter Bayne and I am a software developer.  I've been a dev in one form or another since 1995. I've held various roles from sole developer to team lead, and my experience with dev technologies has ranged from Access to C++ to Fortran to C#, depending on the needs of the day.  Nowadays, I'm most comfortable with C# and Java but I'm always interested in checking out what's coming next.

I don't know about you but I've dragged myself through death-marches, suffered through month-long pre-release-firming test/fix cycles, and tip-toed around the edges of legacy code headered by the comments “don't touch – it just works”.  Frankly, I don't really care to repeat those experiences.  Now don't get me wrong,  I love being a developer and the vast majority of the time it is interesting, challenging, and rewarding, however let's explore the agile principle of doing more of what is great, and doing whatever we can to eliminate that which isn't.

So along those lines, I have a few ideas about some topics to discuss.  What do you think?  If you have an opinion, then please let me know in the comments at the bottom (even anonomously, if you like), or even suggest some of your own.
* Does TDD help devs, or is it a tester conspiracy to do their work for them?
* Architects vs. scrum  - fight!
* Technical debt, legacy code, here be dragons, if it ain't broke...?
* 10 minutes of “unit” tests for every little code change – yeah right.

Of course, as well as all this I'd like to bring you along on my adventures as I build on the developer-focused capabilities here at Clarus, as well as the experiences and discussions I have amongst our developer community in Christchurch.  In this vein, I'd like to make a shout-out to all my new friends at AdScale and Tim Ottinger of Industrial Logic for a great refresher course on all things refactoring-y. If you, the reader, are interested in having a chat, or even getting some developer focused training/coaching, just let me know using the details at the end < /shameless plug>. 

In a world of various management styles and fads from the leanest of scrum-bans to the most structured of waterfalls, let's have a chat about what us developers can do for ourselves to make our professional lives richer.
